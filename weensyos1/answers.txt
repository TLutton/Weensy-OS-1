Response to Exercise 1:

No. It might not work correctly because it is possible for the eax
register to be overwritten which would cause an error. 

Response to Exercise 3:

In order to achieve a blocked implementation, I changed the parent process'
state to P_BLOCKED which means that when schedule() is called, it won't
choose this process to run.  I then gave the child process a new data 
member that holds the process id of the process that is waiting on it.
When the child process finishes in INT_SYS_EXIT, I change the parent's
state back to P_RUNNABLE and put the child process' exit state into
the parent's eax register.
